## Elevator pitch

HubSpot's Growth team achieved a 642% increase in AI citations by restructuring content using semantic triples—a subject-predicate-object writing pattern that helps AI language models understand and cite brand information more effectively.

## Takeaways

- Semantic triples (subject-predicate-object patterns) make content more parseable by AI language models, leading to dramatically higher citation rates
- The "everything bagel strategy" combines semantic optimization with traditional SEO foundations like schema markup and backlinks
- Content should be written for both humans and AI simultaneously—avoid creating separate versions
- Answer-first structure and strategic placement of semantic triples early in paragraphs maximize AI visibility
- Human readability remains paramount; optimization tactics should never compromise the reading experience

## Synthesis

HubSpot's Growth team has released compelling new data on a content optimization technique that dramatically improves AI citation rates. Their experiment yielded a 642% increase in AI citations and a 58% increase in brand mentions across AI platforms, achieved primarily through the implementation of semantic triples in their content.

Semantic triples represent a fundamental linguistic structure consisting of three components: subject, predicate, and object. In practice, this means restructuring sentences to clearly state who or what is being discussed, what action or capability is involved, and what receives that action. For example, "HubSpot can automate email marketing" provides a clean, parseable statement that AI models can easily extract and reference. This contrasts with more conversational or complex sentence structures that may obscure the relationship between concepts.

The methodology involves converting key information from traditional paragraph format into bulleted lists of semantic triples. This approach proves effective because AI language models process content differently than human readers. While humans understand context from surrounding sentences and can infer meaning from narrative flow, AI models benefit from explicit, self-contained statements that clearly establish relationships between entities and concepts.

The HubSpot team developed four practical guidelines for implementing this technique. First, moderation is essential—using one semantic triple per core concept prevents content from becoming robotic or difficult to read. Second, content should be unified, written simultaneously for human engagement and AI comprehension rather than maintained as separate versions. Third, an answer-first structure places key information before supporting details, ensuring that the most citable content appears prominently. Fourth, strategic placement positions semantic triples early in paragraphs where they have maximum impact on both readers and AI crawlers.

Amanda Sellers, HubSpot's head of English Blog Strategy, provides important context: semantic optimization represents one component of a broader "everything bagel strategy." Success in AI visibility requires the foundation of traditional SEO practices including schema markup, authoritative backlinks, and technical site optimization. Semantic triples amplify these existing efforts rather than replacing them.

The team maintains a humorous but practical benchmark for evaluating content: "Would this make me throw my phone in the pool?" This question ensures that optimization tactics never compromise the reading experience. Content that reads awkwardly or feels overly mechanical fails regardless of how well it performs with AI systems.

This research arrives at a pivotal moment as marketers grapple with generative engine optimization (GEO)—the emerging discipline of optimizing content for AI-powered search and answer engines. As more users turn to AI assistants for information, brands must adapt their content strategies to ensure visibility in this new landscape. HubSpot's data suggests that relatively simple structural changes can yield outsized returns in AI citation rates, providing a practical starting point for marketers exploring GEO strategies.
