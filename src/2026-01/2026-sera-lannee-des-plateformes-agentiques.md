## Elevator pitch

Oracle France's CEO Christophe Negrier predicts 2026 will be the year of agentic platforms, as enterprises move from AI proof-of-concepts to embedded solutions while maintaining human oversight over autonomous agents.

## Takeaways

- French AI adoption isn't slow; companies face organizational challenges and policy changes that complicate moving beyond proof-of-concept projects
- Pre-packaged AI in SaaS applications (HR, ERP) drives the most concrete ROI, with one CAC 40 company reporting 50% reduction in development time and 25% net gains after quality controls
- Generative AI requires cloud infrastructure for elasticity, making cloud maturity a prerequisite for successful AI implementation
- No enterprise clients currently delegate 100% task autonomy to AI agents—human oversight remains essential in all deployments
- Oracle projects fiscal year revenues of $65-66 billion, with guidance toward $89 billion next year, dismissing AI bubble theories

## Synthesis

In an interview with Journal du Net, Christophe Negrier, CEO of Oracle France, provides a grounded perspective on enterprise AI adoption and makes a bold prediction: 2026 will be the year of agentic platforms. This forecast comes with important nuances about the current state of AI implementation in French enterprises.

Negrier pushes back against characterizations of French companies as slow AI adopters. The reality, he argues, is more complex. Organizations face significant organizational challenges in moving beyond proof-of-concept projects, compounded by shifting government policies that create uncertainty. The path from experimental AI projects to production deployments requires more than technological capability—it demands organizational readiness and stable policy environments.

The most tangible returns on AI investment currently come from pre-packaged solutions embedded within existing SaaS applications. Human resources and ERP systems with integrated AI capabilities deliver measurable benefits without requiring companies to build custom solutions from scratch. Negrier cites a compelling example from a CAC 40 company that achieved a 50% reduction in development time, translating to 25% net gains even after accounting for necessary quality controls. This suggests that AI's practical impact is already significant for companies taking the embedded approach.

Cloud infrastructure emerges as a critical prerequisite for generative AI success. The computational demands of modern AI systems require the elasticity that only cloud environments can provide. Companies that haven't achieved cloud maturity face compounding difficulties when attempting AI initiatives. Data organization presents another persistent challenge—many enterprises operate with siloed, heterogeneous data sources that create technical obstacles for AI training and deployment.

On the much-hyped topic of AI agents, Negrier offers a measured assessment. While companies are actively exploring agentic capabilities through proof-of-concept testing, none of Oracle's clients currently grant AI agents 100% task autonomy without human oversight. This reflects a prudent approach to autonomous systems—one focused on workforce transformation where employees coexist with and supervise AI agents rather than being replaced by them.

Negrier dismisses comparisons between generative AI and previous technology bubbles like the dot-com era. He points to massive adoption across both B2B and B2C markets as evidence that AI represents genuine value creation rather than speculative hype. Oracle's financial guidance reinforces this confidence: the company projects fiscal year revenues of approximately $65-66 billion, with expectations of reaching $89 billion the following year.

The interview paints a picture of enterprise AI adoption that is substantial but measured. The year ahead may indeed bring agentic platforms to the fore, but their deployment will likely emphasize human-AI collaboration over full autonomy. Companies with cloud maturity and integrated SaaS solutions are best positioned to capture value, while those still grappling with data silos and organizational challenges will continue their slower journey toward AI implementation.
