## Elevator pitch

Google is developing an "Auto Browse" feature for Gemini that will allow the AI assistant to autonomously navigate the web, manage tabs, and execute browsing tasks within Chrome on behalf of users.

## Takeaways

- Google is building an "Auto Browse" capability that enables Gemini to autonomously manage browsing tasks within Chrome
- The feature follows competitive moves from Perplexity Comet and OpenAI Atlas in the agentic browsing space
- Auto Browse will likely be exclusive to the Gemini Ultra subscription tier, positioning it as a premium feature
- Technical implementation includes a Chrome extension sidebar integration with checks verifying Gemini's operational context
- Development has accelerated following Chrome's initial agentic features released in September 2025

## Synthesis

Google is making significant strides in the agentic AI space with its development of "Auto Browse," a new capability that would transform Gemini into an autonomous browsing assistant within Chrome. The feature, which has been spotted in Gemini's internal tools section marked with a cursor icon, represents Google's answer to similar offerings from competitors like Perplexity's Comet and OpenAI's Atlas projects.

The Auto Browse tool is designed to give Gemini the ability to perform web-based tasks independently. Rather than simply answering questions or providing information, Gemini would be able to actively navigate websites, manage browser tabs, and interact with web content on the user's behalf. This marks a significant evolution from the traditional chatbot paradigm toward truly agentic AI systems that can take action in the digital world.

From a technical perspective, the feature appears to be deeply integrated with Chrome's infrastructure. Code analysis suggests that Auto Browse will function through a Chrome extension sidebar, with built-in verification mechanisms to ensure Gemini is operating within the proper extension context. This tight integration with Chrome gives Google a natural advantage in deploying such capabilities, leveraging its dominant position in the browser market.

The business model for Auto Browse appears to follow a premium strategy. Evidence indicates that the feature will be exclusive to Gemini Ultra subscribers, Google's highest-tier AI subscription. This positioning makes sense given the computational demands and potential value of autonomous browsing capabilities, particularly for power users and professionals who could automate significant portions of their web-based workflows.

The timing of this development is notable. Google accelerated work on Auto Browse following the release of Chrome's initial agentic features in September 2025, suggesting a strategic response to the rapidly evolving competitive landscape in AI assistants. The race to build capable AI agents that can interact with the web and perform complex tasks has intensified, with multiple major players vying for dominance.

Potential use cases for Auto Browse are extensive. Users could theoretically delegate research tasks, having Gemini navigate multiple sources and compile information. E-commerce workflows could be streamlined with Gemini handling product comparisons or price tracking. Professional users might automate repetitive web-based tasks that currently require manual navigation through multiple sites and interfaces.

While the feature is not yet publicly available, its presence in Gemini's toolset signals Google's commitment to the agentic AI paradigm. As these capabilities mature, they could fundamentally change how users interact with the web, shifting from active browsing to delegated task execution. The integration of AI agents directly into the browser represents a natural evolution point, and Google's position as both a leading AI developer and the maker of the world's most popular browser positions it uniquely to capitalize on this transformation.
