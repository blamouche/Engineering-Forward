## Elevator pitch

The late 2025 AI model releases have crossed a capability threshold where AI can write 90%+ of production code, fundamentally restructuring the software engineering profession from manual coding to prompt-driven generation.

## Takeaways

- Recent AI models (Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, Gemini 3) represent an inflection point where production-ready code can be generated with minimal prompting
- Traditional skills like prototyping, language polyglotism, and specialized expertise face declining value as AI handles these tasks
- True engineering skills—tech leadership, product thinking, systems architecture—become more valuable as coding itself becomes commodified
- Product management and engineering roles are converging, as both gain overlapping capabilities through AI tools
- Greenfield projects and startups will be first to fully embrace AI-driven development, with potential quality and work-life balance challenges

## Synthesis

Gergely Orosz's analysis marks what he describes as a professional inflection point for software engineering. The article documents how multiple respected industry figures—including Jaana Dogan from Google, Andrej Karpathy (OpenAI co-founder), and Boris Cherny (Claude Code creator)—have publicly confirmed transformative experiences with recent AI models. Dogan reported that AI replicated a year's worth of distributed system work in one hour, while Cherny generated over 200 pull requests entirely through AI in a single month.

The author structures the implications into three categories. Under "The Bad," he identifies skills facing erosion: prototyping becomes accessible to non-technical people, language polyglotism matters less when AI handles syntax across multiple languages, and the traditional frontend/backend specialization distinctions blur as developers can generate code across unfamiliar domains. Well-defined task implementation becomes automatable through AI agents, and even code reading becomes optional for greenfield projects.

Paradoxically, "The Good" reveals how true engineering competencies gain prominence as coding becomes commodified. Tech leadership capabilities become essential, product thinking shifts from specialized skill to baseline expectation, and systems thinking with architectural decision-making differentiates engineers. Code review and validation remain critical, and understanding tradeoffs between solutions increases in importance.

"The Ugly" addresses uncomfortable outcomes: more generated code may introduce latent bugs, weak software practices hurt sooner with high code volume, and work-life balance may deteriorate from pressure to maintain productivity gains. Quality issues from inadequate testing of AI-generated systems present ongoing risks.

A significant structural shift emerges in the relationship between product management and engineering. Product managers can now generate implementations with fewer engineers, while engineers simultaneously need less product management guidance. Role boundaries blur as both professions gain overlapping capabilities, raising questions about whether these roles will merge or separate further.

Orosz assumes AI tools will achieve generating approximately 90%+ of code for many developers during 2026. His own workflow transformed to the point of generating hundreds of lines of production code on his mobile phone through Claude Code, purely through prompting. This shift marks what he describes as a fundamental profession restructuring where "the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse." The tipping point, he argues, occurred with model releases in November-December 2025, with multiple independent engineers confirming reduced desire to manually type code when AI agents provide comparable output faster.
