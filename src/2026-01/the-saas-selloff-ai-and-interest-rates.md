## Elevator pitch

SaaS companies face a dual threat as rising interest rates mathematically compress valuation multiples while AI simultaneously undermines the foundational economics of seat-based pricing and fixed-cost margin structures.

## Takeaways

- Higher interest rates mechanically reduce SaaS valuations through discount rate math: raising the discount rate from 8% to 12% can reduce revenue multiples from 5.0x to 2.78x with no operational changes
- AI-driven productivity gains cause seat compression—even with 25% price increases, a 40% reduction in required seats produces net revenue loss for SaaS vendors
- AI introduces variable per-interaction inference costs into traditionally fixed-cost SaaS businesses, threatening margin structures when inference costs consume the limited headroom in subscription pricing
- Platform bundling by Microsoft, Salesforce, and Notion creates existential pressure on point solutions as LLMs enable incumbents to replicate functionality within their distribution anchors
- Future winners won't differentiate through superior AI capabilities but through business models that remain durable after AI commoditization

## Synthesis

Dave Friedman's analysis dissects the converging pressures reshaping software company economics. Rather than treating the SaaS selloff as a single phenomenon, he identifies two distinct but simultaneous forces—rising discount rates and AI-driven disruption—each capable of independently damaging valuations but devastating in combination.

The interest rate impact operates through pure valuation mathematics. Software companies sell future cash flows, and the present value of those flows depends on discount rates. When rates were near zero, investors accepted high multiples because tomorrow's revenue was worth almost as much as today's. As rates normalized, those multiples contracted mathematically regardless of operational performance. Friedman's calculation is stark: a shift from 8% to 12% discount rates reduces a typical SaaS multiple from 5.0x to 2.78x—a 44% decline before any AI impact enters the picture.

The AI disruption layer attacks SaaS fundamentals more insidiously. Seat-based pricing depends on companies needing a consistent or growing number of software users. AI productivity tools directly threaten this assumption. If AI helps one support agent handle the workload previously requiring three, customers need fewer Zendesk seats. The arithmetic is unforgiving: even aggressive price increases cannot compensate for substantial seat reductions. A 25% price hike combined with 40% seat reduction still produces negative revenue growth.

The cost structure transformation may prove equally damaging. Traditional SaaS enjoys near-zero marginal costs—adding users costs almost nothing once the software exists. AI features introduce variable inference costs proportional to usage. A $100/seat subscription with $5 cost headroom can absorb only limited AI interactions before margins collapse. This fundamentally alters the scaling economics that made SaaS attractive.

The platform bundling threat compounds these pressures. Large platforms with existing distribution—Microsoft through Office, Salesforce through CRM, Notion through productivity—can incorporate AI capabilities that replicate point solution functionality. Point solution vendors must now compete not just on features but against bundled alternatives from platforms customers already pay for. Without a distribution anchor of their own, specialized SaaS companies find their markets compressed from both the productivity side (fewer seats) and the competitive side (bundled alternatives).

Friedman's conclusion reframes the competitive landscape. The relevant question shifts from "who has the best AI?" to "whose business model survives AI commoditization?" Companies that built sustainable economic moats—network effects, unique data assets, workflow entrenchment—will weather these pressures. Those whose primary value proposition was convenient software that AI can now replicate or that platforms can bundle face existential challenges regardless of their AI capabilities.
