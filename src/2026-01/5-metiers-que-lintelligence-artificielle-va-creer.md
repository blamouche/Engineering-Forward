## Elevator pitch

Beyond the anxiety about job displacement, AI is poised to create 170 million new jobs by 2030, many in entirely unprecedented roles that blend technical expertise with domain-specific knowledge and soft skills.

## Takeaways

- The World Economic Forum estimates AI could create 170 million jobs by 2030, with many positions being entirely new categories of work
- Algorithm interpreters will bridge the gap between opaque LLM operations and stakeholders who need to understand their decisions
- Data annotation specialists will combine domain expertise with data science skills to train AI systems accurately
- AI deployment engineers will serve as hybrid consultants who oversee algorithmic integration within specific organizational contexts
- AI risk and governance specialists will navigate the growing landscape of regulations, cybersecurity concerns, and legal compliance across jurisdictions

## Synthesis

Guillaume Renouard's article for Journal du Net challenges the prevalent narrative of AI as primarily a job-destroying force, instead highlighting the significant employment opportunities emerging from artificial intelligence development. Drawing on World Economic Forum projections, the piece argues that AI could create 170 million jobs by 2030, many of which represent entirely new professional categories that don't yet exist in meaningful numbers.

The first role identified is the algorithm interpreter, a position that addresses one of AI's most pressing challenges: explainability. Large language models operate as black boxes, producing results through complex statistical patterns that even their creators struggle to fully understand. This opacity becomes problematic when organizations need to justify decisions to regulators, explain outcomes to customers, or troubleshoot unexpected behavior like hallucinations. Algorithm interpreters will need both deep technical knowledge of how LLMs function and the communication skills to translate these mechanisms for non-technical audiences including managers, executives, and regulatory bodies.

Data annotation specialists represent another critical emerging profession. While data labeling might seem like straightforward work, the article emphasizes that effective annotation requires domain-specific expertise. The example of DNA sequencing illustrates this perfectly: labeling genetic data requires understanding biological processes, not just technical data science skills. As AI systems expand into specialized domains from medical imaging to legal document analysis, the need for annotators who combine subject matter expertise with data science competencies will grow substantially.

The AI deployment engineer role reflects the reality that implementing AI systems requires more than just technical integration. These professionals will function as hybrids between consultants, vendors, and developers, working on-site with organizations for extended periods. Their responsibilities extend beyond code deployment to include algorithm refinement, chatbot design, and organizational integration while understanding sector-specific constraints. This role acknowledges that AI implementation is as much about organizational change management as it is about technology.

AI risk and governance specialists address the rapidly expanding regulatory landscape surrounding artificial intelligence. As jurisdictions worldwide introduce AI-specific legislation and litigation around algorithmic decision-making increases, organizations need dedicated professionals managing legal compliance, cybersecurity risks, and data privacy concerns. This role requires navigating multiple specialties simultaneously—understanding technical AI capabilities, legal requirements across jurisdictions, cybersecurity principles, and organizational risk management.

The final role identified is the custom AI chip specialist. Major technology companies including OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and Meta have moved beyond relying on general-purpose GPUs to designing proprietary semiconductors optimized for their specific AI workloads. This trend will create demand for engineers who understand both chip design fundamentals and business-specific requirements—professionals who can translate organizational AI needs into hardware architecture decisions.

What unifies these five roles is their hybrid nature. None represent pure technical positions or pure business roles; instead, they require combinations of technical expertise, domain knowledge, communication skills, and business understanding. This pattern suggests that AI's impact on employment will be more nuanced than simple automation scenarios suggest. Rather than eliminating jobs wholesale, AI is creating demand for professionals who can bridge between algorithmic capabilities and human organizational needs.

The article implicitly challenges the zero-sum framing that often dominates AI employment discussions. While acknowledging that some positions will be displaced, it emphasizes that new categories of work are emerging that didn't exist previously. These aren't just renamed versions of existing jobs but genuinely novel professional roles responding to challenges created by AI deployment itself—the need to explain algorithmic decisions, train systems accurately, integrate AI into organizations, manage regulatory compliance, and design specialized hardware.

This perspective is particularly relevant for career planning and educational institutions. Rather than focusing solely on coding skills or business acumen, professionals preparing for AI-influenced careers may need to develop hybrid competencies that span technical and non-technical domains. The most valuable skills may be those that help humans and AI systems work together effectively, rather than simply building or using AI systems in isolation.
